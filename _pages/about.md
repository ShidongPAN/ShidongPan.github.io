# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  About #
I am Shidong Pan :)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Data Science at New York University and the Law School at Columbia University (jointly-affiliated).

I completed my Ph.D. at Australian National University and CSIRO's Data61, supervised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/). I was also co-supervised by [Sherry Xu](https://people.csiro.au/X/S/Xiwei-Xu) and [Mark Staples](https://markstaples.com/). I was a visiting PhD student of Prof. [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) in Singapore Management University. I earned Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision at Australian National University, advised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/) and [Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). Before my graduate education, I earned the Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) at Australian National University, advised by [Dongwoo Kim](https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/), and the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University (Weihai). <br>

# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  Research #
My research lies at the intersection of Usable Privacy & Security, Responsible AI, and Law. I am broadly interested in developing methodologies and tools that ensure AI and software systems are usable, secure, and compliant with privacy laws, to implement the general Responsible AI principles in practice. My work emphasizes bridging technical innovations to foster transparency, responsibility, and compliance in ubiquitous software/AIware systems to benefit developers, end-users, and regulators. <br>

1) My work focuses on the privacy policy which bridge the software engineering practices and privacy law compliance, identifying and addressing fundamental challenges of the whole lifecycle of the privacy policy. <br>

- *The usability of privacy policies and notices* [[Security'24 (b)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-pan-shidong-hope.pdf)][[Oakland'25](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2025/223600d878/26hiVNNmd1e)] [<a href="https://ShidongPAN.github.io/_pages/papers/CHI_LBW_Privacy.pdf" target="_blank">CHI'25</a>]

2) My work investigate methods for implementing Responsible AI principles through algorithmic fairness and transparency, exploring ethical challenges and implications. [[AI&Ethics'24(a)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00573-9)][[AI&Ethics'24(b)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00398-y)]
   
3) My research builds foundational insights into software engineering processes to enhance privacy and security, ultimately.

- *Vulnerability Textual Description Augmentation and Utilization* [[TSE'25](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10817126)]
- *Program Analysis for Android Applications* [TOSEM'25][[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17431)]
