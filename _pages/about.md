# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  About #
I am Shidong Pan :)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Courant Institute at New York University and the Law School at Columbia University (jointly-affiliated).

I completed my Ph.D. at Australian National University and CSIRO's Data61, supervised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/). I was also co-supervised by [Sherry Xu](https://people.csiro.au/X/S/Xiwei-Xu) and [Mark Staples](https://markstaples.com/). I was a visiting PhD student of Prof. [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) in Singapore Management University. I earned Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision at Australian National University, advised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/) and [Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). Before my graduate education, I earned the Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) at Australian National University, advised by [Dongwoo Kim](https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/), and the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University (Weihai). <br>

# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  Research #

My research focuses on <b>Usable Privacy Engineering</b>, and <b>Privacy-as-Code</b>, situated at the intersection of $\color{Orange}{\text{Usable Privacy and Security}}$, $\color{Purple}{\text{Empirical Software Engineering}}$, $\color{Pink}{\text{Human-Computer Interaction}}$, and $\color{Brown}{\text{Law}}$. 

 <b>[Usable Privacy Engineering]</b> Recognizing the inevitable utility-privacy trade-offs in software engineering, I aim to develop empirical methodologies and engineering tools that make AIware/software systems both usable and privacy-compliant. My work aims to integrate privacy requirements into development workflows in ways that support both productivity and regulatory alignment. 

 <b>[Privacy-as-Code]</b> My research focuses  "Codifying" various modalities related to privacy, such as textual privacy regulations, documented developer practices (e.g., code of conduct), observed developer practices (e.g., code pattern), software artifacts (e.g., source code, privacy policies, privacy labels), and end-user behavior (habits, perceptions, and interactions). The goal is to bridge the gaps between these heterogeneous elements to create cohesive and actionable privacy mechanisms. 
 
 Collectively, my goal is to deliver technical innovations that serve developers, end-users, and regulators, making privacy not only a legal obligation but an integral part of software engineering practice. Specifically, <br>

1) Privacy Documentation in Software Developement Process $\color{Orange}{\textbf{[UPS]}}$ $\color{Purple}{\textbf{[ESE]}}$ <br>

-  *Engineering-based Process-aware Privacy Policy Generation* 
  [[SEC'24 (a)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-pan-shidong-trap.pdf)][[PETS'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01131)]
-  *Software and Document Analysis-based Privacy Policy/Privacy Labels Generation*
  [[arXiv (a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10923)][[arXiv (b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15407)]

2) Privacy Measurement of AIware/Software and Its Engineering $\color{Orange}{\textbf{[UPS]}}$ $\color{Purple}{\textbf{[ESE]}}$ $\color{Brown}{\textbf{[Law]}}$

- $\color{Brown}{\textbf{[Law]}}$ *Compliance of Privacy Policies against Privacy Laws and Regulations* [[SEC'24 (a)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-pan-shidong-trap.pdf)][[IST'25](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4964855)]
- *The Longtitude Measurement between Software Practices and Privacy Policies* [CCS'25]
- *Large Language Models:* Right to be Forgotten [[AI&E'24 (a)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00573-9)]


3) Usability of Privacy Documentation $\color{Orange}{\textbf{[UPS]}}$ $\color{Purple}{\textbf{[ESE]}}$ $\color{Pink}{\textbf{[HCI]}}$

- *New Approaches/Solutions of Usable Privacy Notices* [[SEC'24 (b)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-pan-shidong-hope.pdf)] [<a href="https://ShidongPAN.github.io/_pages/papers/CHI_LBW_Privacy.pdf" target="_blank">CHI'25</a>]
- *Usability Measurement and Evaluation of Existing Approaches* [[S&P'25](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2025/223600d878/26hiVNNmd1e)]

While my core focus lies in Usable Privacy Engineering and Privacy-as-Code, I also actively contribute to related fields, especially Software Engineering and Responsible AI, through student mentorship and interdisciplinary collaborations.

- Large Language Models for Software Engineering Tasks: *LLMs for Context-aware Code Generation* [[TSE'24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10734067)], *LLMs for Secure Program Generation* [ICSE' 26], *Vulnerability Textual Description Augmentation and Utilization* [[TSE'25](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10817126)][ASEJ'25], and *Program Analysis for Android Applications* [TOSEM'25][[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17431)].

- Algorithmic Fairness especially in Large Language Models: LLM Generation Diversity [[arXiv (c)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15229)] and Machine Unlearning and Algorithmic Fairness of LLMs [[AI&E'24 (b)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00398-y)].
   
More broadly, in the whole landscape of computer science, my work is driven by the need to translate high-level Responsible AI principles (e.g., privacy) into actionable and practical implementations that work across diverse system contexts.<br>

I am also personally interested in research about Computer Science Education in the AI Era and Online Video Games.
