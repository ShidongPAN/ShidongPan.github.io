# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  About #

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Data Science at New York University and the Law School at Columbia University (jointly-affiliated).

My current research interests include <b>Usable Privacy and Security</b>, Privacy Policy, Responsible AI, and Software Engineering. <br>

I completed my Ph.D. at Australian National University and CSIRO's Data61, supervised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/). I'm also co-supervised by [Sherry Xu](https://people.csiro.au/X/S/Xiwei-Xu) and [Mark Staples](https://markstaples.com/). I was a visiting PhD student of Prof. [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) in Singapore Management University. I earned Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision at Australian National University, advised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://people.csiro.au/X/Z/Zhenchang-Xing/) and [Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). Before my graduate education, I earned the Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) at Australian National University, advised by [Dongwoo Kim](https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/), and the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University (Weihai). <br>
