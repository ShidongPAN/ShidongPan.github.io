# Deep Learning Detection of Inaccurate Smart Electricity Meters: A Case Study
[<a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9300285>Paper</a>]


## Abstract
Detecting inaccurate smart meters and targeting them for replacement can save significant resources. For this purpose, a novel deeplearning method was developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict electricity usage trajectories based on historical data. From the significant difference between the predicted trajectory and the observed one, the meters that cannot measure electricity accurately are located. In a case study, a proof of principle is demonstrated for detecting inaccurate meters with high accuracy for practical usage to prevent unnecessary replacement and increase the service lifespan of smart meters.
