<a href="https://waymaker.faith/">Waymaker Church</a> began with a team of Christ followers who answered God’s call. Most of them came from a church small group of young adults. In Fall 2021, they received calling from God — To spread the Gospel among the Chinese neighbors in the northeast of the Greater Seattle Area, they were sent to found a new church there. The leaders fast and prayed together every week and God's vision became clearer and clearer. As an answer to their prayers, six members of the small group decided to be baptized during that period. While they were seeking a place to gather, <a href="https://evergreenchurch.tv/">Evergreen Church</a> in Bothell, WA extended a warm welcome to them, because the Evergreen leaders also had been praying for evangelicalism in the Chinese community. On February 6th, 2022, Waymaker started the first Sunday worship service in the “Uptown Room” of Evergreen Church under the witness of 65 brothers and sisters.

Isaiah 43:18-19<br>
“Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.”
